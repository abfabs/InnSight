# Crete — Area & Travel Guide (RAG)

## Quick identity
Crete is Greece’s largest and most diverse island. It combines beaches, ancient ruins, dramatic gorges, mountain villages, wine regions, and deeply rooted food culture. Unlike smaller Greek islands, Crete isn’t a “one-town” destination — it feels like a small country.

North coast = developed, connected, easier logistics  
South coast = wild, slower, less commercial  

Crete rewards travelers who rent a car and explore beyond one base.

## Best for

- Road-trip style holidays

- Food-focused travelers
- Families (especially east Crete)
- Longer stays (5+ days minimum recommended)

## Not ideal if
- You want compact, walk-everywhere islands like Santorini
