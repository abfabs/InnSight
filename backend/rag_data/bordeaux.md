# Bordeaux — Neighborhood & Travel Guide

## Overview
Bordeaux is elegance bottled — a UNESCO World Heritage city on the Garonne river that has shed its conservative reputation to become one of France's most dynamic destinations. Famous worldwide for its wine, Bordeaux surprises visitors with its stunning 18th-century architecture, booming food scene, and walkable river-front promenade. It's a city that feels grand without being pretentious.

## Neighborhoods

### Centre Historique (Saint-Pierre / Saint-Paul)
The medieval heart of Bordeaux with narrow pedestrian streets, the magnificent Place de la Bourse and its water mirror (Miroir d'Eau), and the Saint-Pierre church. Full of wine bars, restaurants, and small boutiques. This is classic Bordeaux — golden stone buildings glowing in the afternoon sun. Touristy but undeniably beautiful.

### Chartrons
A former wine trading quarter north of the center, now Bordeaux's antique and art gallery district. Sunday morning brings a wonderful antiques market along the quays. Independent coffee shops, natural wine bars, and concept stores line Rue Notre Dame. Great for a more local, creative vibe. Prices are slightly lower than the historic center.

### Saint-Michel
A multicultural, working-class neighborhood centered around the massive Saint-Michel basilica and its Sunday market (one of the biggest in southwestern France). Moroccan, Turkish, and Portuguese restaurants offer cheap, authentic meals. Raw and real — not polished for tourists but full of character. Great for budget travelers.

### Bacalan / Bassins à Flot
The former port area rapidly transforming into Bordeaux's modern quarter. Home to the Cité du Vin (wine museum), the submarine base turned cultural center, and new restaurants. A bit removed from the historic center but connected by tram. Feels like a different city — industrial-chic architecture meets waterfront living.

### Saint-Genès / Nansouty
Residential neighborhoods south of the center popular with students (close to the university). Affordable accommodation, local boulangeries, and neighborhood bistros. Not touristy at all but well-connected by tram. Good for longer stays and those wanting to live like a local.

### Pessac / Talence (Wine Estates)
The southern suburbs blend into the Pessac-Léognan wine appellation — you can visit grand châteaux and taste world-class wines minutes from downtown. Some estates offer accommodation. Best for wine enthusiasts who want to combine city and vineyard experiences.

## Best Time to Visit
- **April–June**: Lovely weather (15-25°C), vineyards turning green, fewer crowds than summer. The Bordeaux Wine Festival happens in even-numbered years in June.
- **July–August**: Warmest (25-32°C), lively terraces, but some locals leave and restaurants can close for vacation.
- **September–October**: Harvest season ("vendanges") — the most exciting time for wine lovers. Perfect temperatures, autumn light on the limestone buildings is spectacular.
- **November–March**: Cooler and rainier, but the city is beautiful in low light. Excellent time for indoor wine tastings and restaurant dining. Very affordable.

## Budget Tips
- Bordeaux is walkable — the entire city center fits in a pleasant 30-minute stroll.
- Trams are cheap and efficient; a day pass covers unlimited rides.
- Wine tastings at the Bar à Vin (CIVB) in the center offer prestigious wines at €2-5 per glass.
- The Marché des Capucins (Saturday and Sunday mornings) is amazing for cheap oysters, charcuterie, and local produce.
- Many châteaux offer free tastings with purchase — much cheaper than formal tasting tours.
- Set lunch menus ("formule déjeuner") at even upscale restaurants are typically €15-25.

## Food & Drink
Bordeaux cuisine is rich and indulgent. Canelés (small caramelized pastries with rum and vanilla) are the city's signature sweet. Entrecôte bordelaise (ribeye with red wine sauce and shallots) is the classic main. Duck in all forms — confit, magret, foie gras — dominates menus. Oysters from Arcachon Bay (30 minutes away) are fresh, cheap, and best enjoyed with white Bordeaux and sausages. The wine, of course, is extraordinary — Bordeaux produces some of the world's finest reds, but the dry whites and sweet Sauternes are equally important.

## Getting Around
The tram network covers the city well with three lines. Cycling is excellent — Bordeaux has an extensive bike-sharing system (VCub) and flat terrain. Walking is the best way to explore the center. High-speed TGV trains connect Bordeaux to Paris in just 2 hours. The airport has budget flights across Europe.
