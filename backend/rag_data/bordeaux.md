# Bordeaux — Neighborhood & Travel Guide (RAG)

## Quick identity
Bordeaux is elegant but relaxed — a UNESCO-listed city of honey-colored limestone, grand squares, river promenades, and world-class wine. It feels sophisticated without being intimidating. The historic center is compact and walkable, and vineyards begin just minutes outside the city.

## Best for
- **Wine lovers** who want access to legendary vineyards
- **Food-focused travelers** (duck, oysters, wine bars, markets)
- **Romantic city breaks**
- **Architecture fans** (18th-century façades, grand boulevards)
- **Slower, refined trips** rather than party-heavy itineraries

## Not ideal if
- You want intense nightlife
- You need nonstop attractions every hour
- You prefer ultra-budget destinations
