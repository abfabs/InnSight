## Travel Pace Advice

2–3 days → Choose one main area and stay central.  
4–5 days → Add a neighborhood + one day trip.  
7+ days → Split base (especially in Crete and Sicily).

Overplanning reduces enjoyment — build in unstructured time.

---

## Trip Personality Matching

Choose Rome if:
- You want overwhelming history.

Choose Lisbon if:
- You want warmth, social energy, and budget balance.

Choose Amsterdam if:
- You want efficiency + culture + nightlife.

Choose Bordeaux if:
- You want wine sophistication.

Choose Crete if:
- You want beaches + villages + food + space.

Choose Sicily if:
- You want intensity + food + layered civilizations.

## Packing Considerations

- Comfortable walking shoes (Rome cobblestones, Lisbon hills)
- Sun protection (Crete, Sicily, Lisbon)
- Light jacket for shoulder season evenings
- Modest attire for churches (Rome)

## Final InnSight Principle

Location and timing shape your experience more than luxury level.

A small apartment in the right neighborhood during shoulder season will outperform a luxury hotel in peak season every time.
