# Sicily — Area & Travel Guide (RAG)

## Quick identity
Sicily is Italy’s most intense region — part Europe, part North Africa, part ancient Greece. It’s volcanic, dramatic, chaotic, and deeply flavorful. Ancient temples, Arab-Norman churches, lava landscapes, turquoise beaches, and some of Italy’s best food coexist on one massive island.

Sicily rewards slow travel and regional hopping. A car makes everything easier.
