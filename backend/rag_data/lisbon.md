# Lisbon — Neighborhood & Travel Guide (RAG)

## Quick identity
Lisbon is a sunlit, hilltop capital overlooking the Tagus River — famous for azulejo tiles, vintage yellow trams, miradouros (viewpoints), seafood, and soulful fado music. It feels authentic, slightly rough-edged in places, and more affordable than many Western European capitals.

Lisbon is built on hills — expect stairs, cobblestones, and elevation changes.

---

## Best for
- First-time Europe trips
- Food-focused travelers
- Budget-conscious city breaks
- Photographers (miradouros + pastel facades)
- Nightlife lovers
- Cultural travelers (fado, history, architecture)

## Not ideal if
- You dislike hills or walking uphill
- You need ultra-modern infrastructure
- You want ultra-quiet evenings (center areas can be lively)
