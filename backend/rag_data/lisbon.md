# Lisbon — Neighborhood & Travel Guide

## Overview
Lisbon is one of Europe's most underrated capitals — a sun-drenched city of seven hills overlooking the Tagus river estuary. Its crumbling pastel facades, tiled buildings (azulejos), world-class food scene, and affordability compared to Western European peers make it increasingly popular. The city has a melancholic charm captured in its fado music tradition.

## Neighborhoods

### Alfama
Lisbon's oldest neighborhood, a labyrinth of narrow streets and stairways spilling down a hillside to the Tagus. Home to the Castelo de São Jorge and the atmospheric fado houses. Early morning visits let you hear the city wake up — church bells, tram rattles, and locals chatting from windows. Touristy around the castle but deeply authentic in its lower streets.

### Baixa
The elegant downtown grid rebuilt after the 1755 earthquake. Grand plazas (Praça do Comércio, Rossio), pedestrian streets lined with shops and cafés, and the iconic Santa Justa Elevator. Very central and well-connected but can feel commercial. Great base for first-time visitors who want easy access to everything.

### Bairro Alto
The bohemian upper quarter that transforms at night into Lisbon's party central. By day, it's a quiet neighborhood of small shops and restaurants. After 10pm, the streets fill with people hopping between tiny bars. A unique nightlife experience where the party spills outdoors. Not ideal for light sleepers.

### Chiado
Lisbon's most elegant neighborhood, wedged between Baixa and Bairro Alto. Historic cafés (A Brasileira, where Fernando Pessoa used to write), theaters, bookshops (Livraria Bertrand, the world's oldest), and upscale dining. Great for culture lovers. More refined than Bairro Alto, more charming than Baixa.

### Príncipe Real
A trendy, upscale neighborhood with beautiful garden squares, concept stores, brunch spots, and a progressive atmosphere. Popular with the creative class and LGBTQ+ community. The botanical garden and Saturday organic market are highlights. Slightly removed from the tourist intensity but very walkable to everything.

### Belém
West along the river, home to the Tower of Belém, Jerónimos Monastery (UNESCO), and the unmissable Pastéis de Belém bakery (custard tarts since 1837). More spread out and requires a tram or bus to reach from the center. Worth a half-day trip. The MAAT museum of art and technology is architecturally stunning.

### Mouraria
Multicultural and gritty, Mouraria is where fado was actually born (not Alfama, despite popular belief). A mix of Portuguese, Chinese, Indian, and African communities. Authentic restaurants with incredibly low prices. Street art around every corner. It's being gentrified rapidly but still retains its rough, real character.

### Graça
A hilltop neighborhood east of Alfama with some of the best views in Lisbon from the Miradouro da Graça and Miradouro da Senhora do Monte. More residential and less touristy. The famous Tram 28 passes through. Good for travelers wanting a quieter base with panoramic vistas.

## Best Time to Visit
- **March–May**: Spring is gorgeous. 15-22°C, flowers blooming, outdoor terraces open. Easter festivities add charm.
- **June–September**: Peak season. 25-35°C, plenty of sunshine. Festas de Lisboa in June transform the city with sardine grills and street parties. July-August can be very hot and crowded.
- **October–November**: Mild (15-22°C), fewer tourists, great for walking. Some rain but rarely persistent.
- **December–February**: Mild winters (8-15°C), cheapest accommodation. Can be rainy but sunny days are common.

## Budget Tips
- The Lisboa Card covers unlimited transit + free/discounted museum entry — pays for itself in 1-2 days.
- Eat at "tascas" (small local restaurants) for lunch menus under €8. Look for "prato do dia" (daily plate).
- Ginjinha (cherry liqueur) shots are €1-2 at tiny bars throughout Baixa and Rossio.
- Free viewpoints (miradouros) offer better views than any paid attraction.
- Take the public Tram 28 instead of tourist tram tours — same route, fraction of the price.

## Food & Drink
Lisbon is a food paradise. Must-tries: Bacalhau (salted cod, prepared 365+ ways), pastéis de nata (custard tarts), bifanas (pork sandwiches), sardinhas assadas (grilled sardines, especially in June). Seafood is exceptional and affordable. Time Out Market in Cais do Sodré gathers the city's best chefs under one roof. Portuguese wine is outstanding and cheap — a good bottle of Alentejo red costs €3-5 at a supermarket.

## Nightlife
Bairro Alto is the epicenter — dozens of tiny bars in a few blocks, everyone drinks in the streets. Cais do Sodré (Pink Street) has become the trendy club area. LX Factory hosts alternative events and markets. Fado shows in Alfama and Mouraria offer a uniquely Portuguese evening experience (look for "vadio" — amateur fado — for the most authentic performances).
