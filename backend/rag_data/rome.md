# Rome — Neighborhood & Travel Guide

## Overview
Rome is the Eternal City — 2,700+ years of history layered on top of itself. Ancient ruins, Renaissance art, baroque fountains, and world-famous food all coexist in a city that manages to feel both grand and intimate. Walking through Rome is like walking through a living museum where every corner reveals another masterpiece.

## Neighborhoods

### Centro Storico (Historic Center)
The ancient heart of Rome encompassing the Pantheon, Piazza Navona, and Campo de' Fiori. Stunning architecture on every block, fantastic restaurants, and a buzzing street life. Very touristy and expensive, but the density of things to see is unmatched anywhere in the world. Best for first-time visitors with limited days.

### Trastevere
A charming, bohemian neighborhood across the Tiber river. Cobblestone streets, ivy-covered buildings, and some of Rome's best trattorias. Lively nightlife scene popular with both locals and students. It retains a village-like atmosphere despite being very central. One of the most recommended areas for travelers seeking authentic Roman character.

### Monti
Rome's oldest rione (district) and now its hippest. Independent boutiques, vintage shops, wine bars, and artisan workshops fill the streets between the Colosseum and Termini station. Great for couples and solo travelers. It feels local despite being steps from Rome's biggest attractions.

### Testaccio
A working-class neighborhood that's become Rome's undisputed food capital. The historic Testaccio Market, old slaughterhouse turned cultural center (MACRO), and some of the city's most authentic pasta and supplì. Nightlife centers around Monte Testaccio, a hill literally made of ancient Roman pottery shards, now surrounded by clubs.

### Prati / Vatican Area
The elegant neighborhood surrounding Vatican City. Wide, tree-lined boulevards, upscale shopping, and excellent restaurants catering to a mix of locals and pilgrims. Quieter than Centro Storico but very well-connected via Metro. Best for families and travelers wanting a refined base near St. Peter's and the Vatican Museums.

### San Lorenzo
University district near Sapienza with a young, edgy vibe. Street art, cheap eats, international cuisine, and rome's liveliest bar scene outside of Trastevere. Accommodation is significantly cheaper here. Great for budget travelers and those seeking nightlife.

### Esquilino / Termini
The area around Rome's main train station is multicultural and sometimes chaotic, but incredibly convenient for transport. Piazza Vittorio has a great daily market. Some of Rome's best ethnic food is here — Chinese, Indian, Ethiopian, Bengali. Not the prettiest area, but practical and budget-friendly.

## Best Time to Visit
- **April–May**: Perfect weather (15-24°C), gardens blooming, manageable crowds. Easter brings special events.
- **June**: Still lovely before peak summer heat. Long evenings perfect for outdoor dining.
- **July–August**: Hot (30-35°C+), many locals leave the city. Fewer crowds at some spots, but heat can be exhausting.
- **September–October**: Arguably the best months. Warm but not punishing, locals return, restaurants are at their best.
- **November–March**: Cheapest season. Mild winters (5-14°C), occasional rain. Museums without crowds.

## Budget Tips
- Rome is best explored on foot — most major sights are within walking distance of each other.
- Free to enter: Pantheon, St. Peter's Basilica, all public fountains and piazzas.
- Eat "pranzo" (lunch) at trattorias for fixed-price menus, often €10-15 for a full meal.
- Avoid restaurants directly facing major piazzas — walk one block away for better prices and quality.
- The Roma Pass covers 1-2 museum entries + unlimited public transit.
- Water fountains (nasoni) are everywhere — bring a refillable bottle.

## Food & Drink
Rome has a fiercely traditional food culture. The "four pastas" you must try are: Carbonara (egg, pecorino, guanciale), Cacio e Pepe (pecorino and black pepper), Amatriciana (tomato, guanciale, pecorino), and Gricia (guanciale and pecorino, no tomato). Supplì (fried rice balls) are the quintessential Roman street food. Pizza in Rome is thin and crispy (pizza al taglio). For gelato, look for places that keep it in covered metal tubs, not piled-high colorful mountains.

## Getting Around
Walking is the best way to experience Rome. The Metro has two useful lines (A and B) that cross at Termini. Buses can be confusing but cover areas the Metro doesn't. Taxis use meters — make sure they're running. Cobblestones mean comfortable shoes are essential. E-scooter rentals are popular but the chaotic traffic requires confidence.
